CHALLENGE 1

Supplied code creates a class extension which allows to define tags on its instances.
Since we want every object to has its own list of tags, we override initialize method,
so it sets the instance variable for given object to default list of tags specified for the class.

However something is nto working as expected - for some reason altering instance variable of one object
alters it for all its siblings. 

Find out why!

Note: This might seem extremly complicated at start, however understanding this problem will give you a great insight
into internal ruby mechanism.






CHALLENGE 2

This one should be much easier. We have rails application with just one controller with action 'custom'.
Our current job was to install 'wicked' (https://github.com/schneems/wicked) gem and implement it on our controller.
However as soon as you added line `include Wicked::Wizzard`, the custom action started to throw an exception.

Localize the problem and find a solution.
